    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm. In other words, it evaluates how efficiently an algorithm performs with larger inputs. An algorithm is considered more efficient if it has a lower time complexity.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to complete its execution. The notation used to represent space complexity is often denoted as O(f(n)), where 'n' is the size of the input. In this notation, 'O' stands for order, and 'f(n)' represents the upper bound of the function that describes the growth rate of the space required. An example of space complexity is O(n), where the space required grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in designing algorithms, as it helps in understanding and optimizing the memory usage of an algorithm.</p>
